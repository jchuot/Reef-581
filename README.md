## Notes

### Justine 4/16
- 4/16
	- login.html is referenced when clicking the "Login" button in the corner
- 4/17
	- index.html has 2 "sizes" (normal desktop & max-width: 700px)
		- when using inspect use iphone SE & ipad Pro
	- the sidebar and header can adjust to the responsive design
	- menu bar can open but closing functionality is not yet working
	- also there is are separate header files. I am trying to get the header to be constant on all of the webpages
		- not fully funtional
			- can display but the hrefs are not working
		- for now, may have to copy & paste header
